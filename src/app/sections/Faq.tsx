                            Our security measures encompass a range of best practices and coding standards. Developers utilize battle-tested libraries from OpenZeppelin as the foundation for our smart contracts and Foundry for testing. Each contract has restricted upgrade capabilities, limited owner rights, and controlled modification of critical variables to prevent unauthorized changes. The protocol is permission-less and only uses servers to enhance trading functionality. More info about our smart contract design,&nbsp;

                        The first index product will launch on Arbitrum. Our smart contracts are multichain-compatible via Chainlink CCIP, starting with EVM-compatible chains. In the future, we plan to expand to non-EVM chains like Solana, leveraging tools such as Solang for compatibility. Finally, through 3rd party integration, bridging (and swap and on/off-ramp) will be made available to enable widespread access, all from a single dashboard.

                        Nexlabs has collected a substantial amount of historical data ranging from crypto protocols and transaction details per block to stock-market assets. Fund performance automatically calculated using api calls to, a.o., Nexlabs' subgraph and is daily updated. Once funds go live on mainnet(s), recent performance will be based on assets under management from the smart contracts. Backtesting data will also be made available for backtest result in the 'Build Your Own Index' program.
